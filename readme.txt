This plugin integrates Affiliates with eShop.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates [Affiliates](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates/) with [eShop](http://www.quirm.net/).

With this integration plugin, referrals are created automatically for your affiliates when sales are made through eShop.

The plugin allows you to set a referral (commission) rate so that your affiliates get credited with a referral based on a percentage of each sale's total net amount.

*Affiliates* allows you to maintain your own affiliate program to boost sales through your online store powered by eShop. This is what you need:

- [eShop](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/eshop)
- [Affiliates](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/affiliates)
- [Affiliates eShop Integration Light](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/affiliates-eshop-light) (this plugin)

Install these, set up your shop, set the referral rate for affiliates and distribute your affiliates their affiliate links. Whenever an affiliate refers a client to your store and the client makes a purchase, you will see a referral created for the affiliate.

__eShop Test Mode__

Please note that in eShop's Test Mode, no referrals are recorded.
